## Workout Tracker
This python program is meant to ask the user for an input for a workout they have completed and it logs it into a spreadsheet on Google Sheets.
The spreadsheet is located [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DHL6Y8XAHSC_KhJsa9QMekwP8b4YheWZY_sxlH3i494/edit?usp=sharing). Make a copy of this spreadsheet in your own Google drive account. 
In order to use Google sheets, we are using [Sheety](https://sheety.co/).

We are also using the [Nutritionix](https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api) API to get exercise statistics using natural language input from the user.

API keys and tokens are stored in a .env file, which is git-ignored.
